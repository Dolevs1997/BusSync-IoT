# BusSync-IoT Project

: BusSync IoT is an innovative IoT device designed to enhance communication and efficiency between bus drivers and passengers at bus stations.
The core component of BusSync IoT is a smart LEDS in the bus driver, integrated with sensors and communication technology. 
When passengers arrive at a bus station and are ready to board, they can activate the BusSync IoT system using a designated button at the station, signaling their intention to board the bus. 
This information is relayed to the bus LEDS in real-time, allowing them to accurately identify and synchronize with waiting passengers

# Features
**ESP32 Microcontroller** : The core of the project, handling all operations and communication.
**Blynk Integration**: Remote monitoring and control via the Blynk mobile app.
**Multiple LCDs**: Display real-time data from sensors for easy visualization.
**Push Button Listener**: Detects and responds to button presses for interactive control.
**Ultrasonic Distance Measurement**: Measures distances and displays them on LCDs for monitoring bus incoming.
**WiFi Connectivity**: Connects to a WiFi network for Blynk communication and real-time updates.
